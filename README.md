# How To Get Started

## Setup

To get started, you would need your Yeerlo **CreatorID** which can be gotten from your Yeerlo creator dashboard at https://app.yeerlo.com. This is required to ensure only your events and personal information are properly displayed.

### How To Update Your CreatorID

1. Navigate to your `nuxt.config.ts` file.  
2. In the `runtimeConfig` section, locate the **CreatorID**.  
3. Replace the default CreatorID value with **your own CreatorID**.  
4. Save the file to apply the changes.

Hint: your **CreatorID** can be gotten from your Yeerlo dashboard profile as shown in the image preview below:
